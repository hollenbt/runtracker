Move myAccount to the home page (if logged in), otherwise redirect to login page.

Create new Account (settings) page, where you can change password and delete account.

Combine logRun and addCourse in one page. Allow creation of a variation of an existing course, or from
a chosen starting location. Saving course not required to log a run, but should prompt user to save before
leaving page.

Style, baby.
